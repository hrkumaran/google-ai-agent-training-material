Day 1

🎒 Today’s Assignments

Complete the Unit 1 – “Introduction to Agents”:

Listen to the summary podcast episode for this unit.
To complement the podcast, read the “Introduction to Agents” whitepaper.
Complete these codelabs on Kaggle:
Build your first agent using Gemini and Agent Development Kit (ADK). 
Build your first multi-agent systems using ADK.
Make sure you phone verify your Kaggle account before starting, it's necessary for the codelabs. 
We also have a troubleshooting guide for the codelabs. Be sure to check there for solutions to common problems.

💡 What You’ll Learn

Today’s whitepaper introduces Al agents. It presents a taxonomy of agent capabilities, emphasizes the need for an Agent Ops discipline for reliability and governance, and discusses the importance of agent interoperability and security through identity and constrained policies.  

In today's codelabs, you'll be building your first AI agent and your first multi-agent system, using ADK, powered by Gemini, and giving it the ability to use Google Search to answer questions with up-to-date information. In the second codelab, the focus will be on multi-agent systems, where you'll learn how to create teams of specialized agents and explore different architectural patterns.

📋 Reminders

Tomorrow at 11:00 AM PT, Kanchana Patlolla and Anant Nawalgaria will host the first livestream on Kaggle’s YouTube channel. They’ll be joined by codelab authors Kristopher Overholt and Hangfei Lin, along with other special guests from Google: Alan Blount, Mike Clark, Michael Gerstenhaber and Antonio Gulli to discuss the assignments and share insights. 
This course page serves as the central hub for all event resources, including assignments and important updates.
Kaggle's Discord is the best place to ask questions. In addition to other participants, several Googlers are there to help. During the livestream, we'll also pick some questions from Discord to discuss. You'll get Kaggle swag if your question is chosen!
We want this community to be positive and supportive. Please follow Kaggle’s community guidelines found here.

Day 2

Complete Unit 2 - “Agent Tools & Interoperability with Model Context Protocol (MCP)”:

Day 3
Complete Unit 3 - “Context Engineering: Sessions & Memory”:

Listen to the summary podcast episode for this unit, created by NotebookLM.
To complement the podcast, read the “Context Engineering: Sessions & Memory whitepaper".
Complete these codelabs on Kaggle:
Build stateful agents and perform context engineering.  
Explore how to use memory with your agent.
We also have a troubleshooting guide for the codelabs. Be sure to check there for solutions to common problems.

💡 What You’ll Learn

This whitepaper explores context engineering as the practice of dynamically assembling and managing information within an agent's context window to create stateful and personalized Al experiences. It defines Sessions as the container for a single, immediate conversation's history, and Memory as the long-term persistence mechanism.
